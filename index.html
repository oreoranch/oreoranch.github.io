					<h3>Who are we?</h3>
					<p>
						Here at Oreo Ranch Annex, we strive to raise happy and healthy belted galloways as grass-fed cattle. Oreo cows, pasture pandas, belted galloways, whatever you prefer to call them, are beautful meat producing cows. They are a very attractive breed of cattle that fares well on grass feeding. Our cows enjoy nearly 12 acres of fresh green grass, shady trees, and areas to roam. We work with our animals daily, keeping them friendly and healthy.
